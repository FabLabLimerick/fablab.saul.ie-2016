Hello. In order to use any Fab Lab equipment please book [here](http://fablablimerick.schedulista.com).

And please note, to use a machine, you need to have completed the relevant Introductory course, which you can find out about [here](http://fablab.saul.ie/recurrents/sat-equipment-intro/)

Reserving a time on our scheduler, will reserve the machine for you for that time. For Lasercutting the booking is 30 mins minimum; for 3D printing and CNC cutting, booking is hourly. Please book as many slots as you require. You can cancel a booking up to an hour before.

The prices for the respective machines are on the equipment pages [below](http://fablab.saul.ie/how/equipment/).

As a warm-up project before attempting the much more complex laser cutter machine, we decided to build a  RepRap 3d printer during the first week of SAUL spring 2013 elective programme. This open-source, self-replicable 3D printer by Javier Bur√≥n, Michael McLaughlin, Stephen Bourke, Emmanuel Chomarat, David Grace, Weixang Huang, Peter Lawlor & Klest Pango.

This model is a great entry-level equipment for learning how additive manufacturing technology works and starting using them in a design studio environment. Although the assembly took only 5 full days, the commissioning and calibration process required at least two more weeks part time.

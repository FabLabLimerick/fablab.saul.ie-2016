This course will explain the concept of 3D printing and demonstrate how to use a 3D printer with demonstrations on our Ultimaker2 and more. 3D printing is an extremely versatile prototyping technology which has a large variety of available materials. And 3D printing is a very accessible technology, advancing all the time with dedicated online communities and open source designs.

### 1:00pm : Advanced 3D printing (including SLA Printing)
Stereolithography (SLA) opens up many new possibilities - high resolution printing in resin and wax printing is used in medical industries, metal-working, and high-quality prototypes.

The courses are each introductory courses, so no previous experience is required. All ages are welcome (under 14's must be accompanied by an adult)

In March 2013 and during the SAUL elective programme we built an open source laser cutter. The [Lasersaur](http://www.lasersaur.com/) project has a 120W laser and can cut and engrave metal, timber and plastics. The laser cutter was assembled by Javier Burón, Michael McLaughlin, Stephen Bourke, Emmanuel Chomarat, David Grace, Weixang Huang, Peter Lawlor & Klest Pango. Our friend Carlos Cámara from the ETSA USJ in Zaragoza, Spain visited us during the assembly process.

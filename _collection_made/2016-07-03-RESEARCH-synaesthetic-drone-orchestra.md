My residency proposal for the Future Artist Maker summer bootcamp was based around explorations of fabrication techniques in the production of educational kits. This work sits within a continuum of research and experimentation into musical instrument design, STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, Maths) and digital fabrication that I have conducted for the past 2-3 years. At the time of the bootcamp I chose to explore two separate areas. One was an investigation into the suitability and feasibility of using tensioned, then stiffened fabrics over wooden frames, while the other was a battery powered, sound sampling amplified speaker cabinet.

### MonoLute

Deriving its name from the fact it was designed to be able to produce just one note at a time on a single string (mono), and that it most readily resembled the family of stringed instruments consisting of a resonator body with attached neck (lute), the MonoLute saw several iterations of development during the two week long bootcamp. Using a revolved profile modelled in 3D CAD program Fusion 360, followed by generation of 2D radial slice data using 123D Make (both AutoDesk softwares), the frame was laser cut firstly with 1.5mm birch plywood (too thin), then 4mm (too thick) before we settled on 3mm birch ply, which gave an adequate strength-to-weight ratio. Early iterations proved too weak using just the 123D Make output, so a considerable amount of my time was given over to adjusting DXF drawings to make the frame more rigid. Meanwhile, my teammate Maureen was tasked with mapping fabric to the undulations of the frame. We tried several types of fabric. Initially I had based my plans on the use of polyurethane impregnated polyester as used in tensile membrane architecture, but this proved unsuitable as it would only stretch on one axis. After some experimentation we settled on a white polyester / spandex mix that had adequate stretch characteristics and aesthetic appeal. Maureen laser cut and stitched the fabric to make a “sock” that covered the frame. We made two models simultaneously to try different stiffening methods. PVA was painted onto the first model (covered with tights fabric), which proved too flexible, and thus ineffective. On the other was painted fibreglass resin, which had the desired effect of stiffening the fabric and giving a gloss sheen. Laser kerfed plywood was used to give the soundboard fabric a compound curved profile.

### SoundCatcher

The second experiment was based on an idea for a tool that could be used in educational workshops to record and playback audio captured with a number of different sound sensors. My teammate Laura and her partner Rudolfo designed the software, control panel and enclosure to my specifications. The microcontroller used to record audio was the Teensy Arduino with audio adaptor board, allowing CD quality recordings. The user had control over the recording, playback and volume of 3 channels of audio via the top control panel. An amplifier and speaker as well as the Arduino, batteries and controls were housed in a faux-leather fabric covered, laser cut MDF enclosure.

### Fab Lab Facilities use

During this residency my team and I made heavy use of the laser cutters. I used the CNC router to route two parts for the MonoLute out of hardwood, and the Ultimaker 2 3D printer to print some mechanical parts for both projects. The laser cutters were most suited to the time frame of the project. Fast iterations with little time spent in setup make this a highly useful tool for this sort of residency. With the router, far more time was spent on setup and tool changing than actual cutting, and the turnaround and resulting quality of 3D printed parts was often frustrating. Obviously how one designs for a technology or tool has a direct bearing on the outcome, so with the latter my approach was perhaps too demanding / optimistic of the capabilities of the printer.

### Working with a team

Initially the plan had been to have up to 6 collaborators to each chosen artists. In the end only 6 showed up, two of whom fell to the wayside shortly after the start of the first week. However it soon became obvious (to me at least) that the two collaborators I had were highly competent and skilled designer / craftspeople, and given the limited time, having a larger team would have meant a lot more time spent on project management rather than designing or making. Perhaps with a month or longer a larger team would achieve huge advances, but only after a significant amount of time spent on training and indoctrination to get everyone swimming in synch.

### Conclusion

At the time of writing, over two months after the end of the bootcamp, I have had very little free time to digest the outcomes of my involvement. It was an important award for me it was my first opportunity to delegate tasks to other skilled people. Up until that point I had for the overwhelming majority of my career worked alone, whether I liked it or not. Having a concentrated time period with access to skilled labour, materials, cutting edge technology and mentorship was a very positive experience and a privilege.

Aoife Browne, director of ESUVIA is the Artist who created “Digital Veil” in collaboration with Fab Lab Limerick and contributors, **Ciaran Trotman, Yasmin McMahon and Georgina Johnson**.

The \'screen effect\' is commonplace today on the internet with the boundary condition of personal protection at risk with some online interaction resulting in cyber bullying. Browne’s use of a patterned screen is like a filter, through which, the invited public are presented with a digitally fabricated veil; revealing only what the pattern as interference allows the viewer to see. This experience can be perceived on many levels and may provoke conversation about our boundary condition norms.

Browne’s work with pattern exposes the Digital Veil which takes the form of an Irish 5 Fold Symbol. The origin of this design may come from what the Japanese call a “Bokeh” which translated means “Blur”. In Celtic terms the 5 Fold Symbol is believed to represent A Compass or The 4 Seasons. It is the interplay of light through the Digital Veil, with movement and time along a path that: for a moment, you might get a glimpse of the artist intent, which is, to celebrate the shower of light that shines (rather than rains) on our parade of diversity in Ireland today. From childhood we looked at Grannies neighbours through her lace curtains and we felt protected by this lace veil which hid us from sight. Opening the front door to a stranger was and is a different condition entirely that involves, a feeling of trust.

Exhibited at “Hybrid” An exhibition in Limerick from the 24th of October-4th of November, 2016.

If happiness is process then making the Digital Veil was a happy time. Participation, Experimentation, Sharing, Evolving, Adapting, Resourcefulness, Energy, Synergy, Purpose, Place, People and Pink all sum up the effect and result of collaboration with diverse creative peoples skills and interests. Yes, working in a cross pollination group brought more ideas to the table. Yes, working with other people brought energy and pace to the process. And Yes, Fab Lab SAUL is unique because the spirit of the facility is an open forum for creativity hence, even Browne could do PINK. When I was a child- I called the fall of Cherry Blossoms in Spring,” Pink Snow”.

I can’t recommend Fab Lab Saul enough. **#FabTime@FabLab**

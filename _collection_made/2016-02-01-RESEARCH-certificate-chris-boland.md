This stool was born of necessity. It was the long awaited fruit of a procrastinated promise. It in some senses reflects this need to fulfill a promise speedily, by necessity and pragmatically. I wanted the stool to be simple to assemble yet structurally sound, to reflect its material and its construction yet also go beyond the flatness and weight of manufactured board.

The initial design inspiration I found online with a design for a ‘faceted chair’ which I thought I could use as my starting point. This chair has a simple elegance, an economy of design, a material and an understated style which appealed to me. This economy of design and function before form was something I wanted my own design to reflect.

Having studied the ‘faceted chair’ and settled upon my own aesthetic and practical requirements I began to sketch out some initial ideas and refine them on paper. Certain elements such as the back rest and multiple seat facets I discarded as I considered them superfluous or contrary to my desire for simplicity. A desire for simplicity both in design and construction I think can help you to be ruthless in the initial design process, complicated aesthetic whimsy and ornament is generally easy to identify and pencil is easy to erase.

Having settled on a particular sketch I liked, I then translated this into a digital format using auto-cad. Fab lab’s philosophy and equipment encourages and facilitates experiment and scaled modelling before full scale production. Considering this I laser cut some of my initial designs from the auto-cad file and decided that I wanted make the stool visually lighter by incorporating some cut outs. This modelling or prototyping process helped me tease out my design concerns and refine my design to a point where I was happy to go full scale on the router.

The final product was routed from 18mm birch ply, sanded and assembled with friction fit joints and using no glue. I finished the stools with an oak dye and three coats of finishing oil. The stool makes a feature of the router cut joints, I guess the aesthetics are about showing rather than hiding which reflects the notion of simplicity. It would have been harder to retain structural integrity and also hide the joints, perhaps it’s what I could call aesthetic honesty or perhaps being more honest it’s just laziness. I like the way in which the stool shows off the face or ‘pretty’ side of the birch ply and the layered wafer like construction or body of the board, ‘the meat in the sandwich’ so to speak. Again the friction fit construction, and simple rubbed on oil finish reflects my initial desire for economy. The first one was so good I made another and they are both still standing.

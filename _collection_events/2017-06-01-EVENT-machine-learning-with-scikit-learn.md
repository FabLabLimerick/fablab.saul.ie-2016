There are several Python libraries which provide solid implementations of a range of machine learning algorithms. One of the best known is Scikit-Learn, a package that provides efficient versions of a large number of common ML algorithms. 

In this presentation, we will demonstrate some of the best known algorithms, including clustering algorithms, randof Forest and Logistic Regression. 

Azure notebooks will be provided so that you can try out the examples yourself. (See [notebooks.azure.com](http://notebooks.azure.com) for more details)

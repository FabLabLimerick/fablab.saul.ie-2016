**FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS** is a programme which explores the potential for artists and creatives to experiment with digital fabrication in their artistic practice. FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS is a programme developed by The Nerve Centre in Derry, Ultralab in Madrid and Fab Lab Limerick and co-funded by Creative Europe programme of the European Union.

This exhibition explores how today’s artist-makers are embracing the latest digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers, to imagine, design and create artworks that otherwise might not be possible. FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS also highlights how artist-makers from across Europe are critically engaging with the Fab Lab ethos of open-source design, creative collaboration and hardware hacking, and how the combination of ‘new machines, new materials and new networks’ are beginning to make their mark.

The exhibition launches on **March 15th 2017, at 7:00pm**. And is open to the public from March 16th, each day **Monday to Saturday, 9am to 5pm**, and will remain open until **May 6th**.

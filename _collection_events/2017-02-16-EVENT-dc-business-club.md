### About your facilitator, Fergal O' Farrell
I love working with individuals and groups of people who are pushing personal and work boundaries, I really admire those who are challenging the status quo, pushing their personal limits as they grow personally and develop their ideas/projects/start-up enterprise.
I have over 20 years’ experience working in an international retail environment in financial, planning and organisation development roles. I have been involved in food and technology start-ups and I understand the challenges – the highs and the lows. I have an MSc in Business Practice as well as qualifications in coaching, and accountancy.

My approach is based on the philosophy that deep down we each know what we want to do and that we are equipped with the resources and strengths to follow our dreams and to achieve our goals.
However it doesn’t always feel like we know where we want to go or how to get there.

My role is to help you figure out how to move forward, achieve your goals and see your dreams come through. *“Follow your dreams they know the way”.*

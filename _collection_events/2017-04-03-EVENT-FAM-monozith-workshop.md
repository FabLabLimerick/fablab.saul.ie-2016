Build a MonoZith - a single stringed, fretted electric zither - in this intensive 3 hour workshop. The bulk of the instrument will be laser cut in-house and assembled by participants. Position frets made from bamboo skewers, snap together finger joined MDF and birch plywood, solder the pickup to the output jack, and learn techniques relevant to both instrument building and digital fabrication and construction. By the end of the workshop participants will leave with a functioning instrument they can plug into an amp and rock out to!

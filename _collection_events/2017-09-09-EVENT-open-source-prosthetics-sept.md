Open Creators Limerick, in collaboration with the Fab Lab Limerick, School of Architecture, UL and the Health Hub Limerick, UL invite you to come along and learn about 3D printing technology and other topics related to prosthetic design.
**This Open Day is organised as part of Elemental 2017, visit [elementalfestival.com](http://www.elementalfestival.com/) for more details.**


Open Creators Limerick are a community of volunteers collaborating to create assistive products that make life a little easier for others. From prosthetic arms to tactile learning aids for the visually impaired, they produce and share free open source designs using digital fabrication technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting. 

On the day, a number of current projects will be displayed and activities will run throughout the day for visitors to join in on. 

The community is always delighted to welcome new volunteers, regardless of skills or background, so please drop by or send [an e-mail](mailto:handprints.ireland@gmail.com) if you are interested in lending a hand.

Drawing inspiration from the global [e-Nable network](http://enablingthefuture.org) we are kickstarting a local community of designers, manufacturers, medical experts, tinkerers and volunteers to explore new ways of using digital fabrication for upper limb prosthesis.

Within the project there are many roles to fill and various opportunities to tackle new challenges around providing local community members with a helping hand. This first workshop will be an introduction to the project and a first opportunity to network and collectively create amongst like minded people.

The workshop starts at 6.30 pm. The event is free, all are welcome though **registration is required**.

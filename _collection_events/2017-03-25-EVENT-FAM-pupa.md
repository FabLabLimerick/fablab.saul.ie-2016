Beyond The Bark presents Pupa, The freakish metamorphic tale of us.

A puppet girl struggling with her disability splits herself in two, casts of her disabled part and banishes it to the room of forgotten limbs. A Man falls from normality, breaks and reforms. As they go on their quests to find a sense of wholeness they navigate a dark world, encountering many characters on their way: a wise bug; fragmented and broken bodies; singing mouths in jars and silence. Mixing puppetry, physical performance, digital fabrication and song, we will tell the freakish metamorphic tale of us. Audiences will be lead through a multi-sensory, interactive, Kafkaesque, telling of Pinocchio as never seen before.

In collaboration with Belltable, Future Artist-Maker, Fab Lab Limerick, The New Play Clinic and Mary Immaculate College. Capacity: 20 for each performance. Tickets €12/€10 https://www.limetreetheatre.ie/show/pupa/

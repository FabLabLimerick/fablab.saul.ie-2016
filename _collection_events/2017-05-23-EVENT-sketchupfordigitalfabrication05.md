**Sketchup for Digital Fabrication** has been designed to help users bring their ideas into 3D using the digital fabrication tools available at Fab Lab Limerick. This course will run over four weeks, introducing learners to the potential of SketchUp, a 3D modeling software. The course will guide the users through the very basics of SketchUp allowing everyone to fully grasp the power and ease at which we can create and design in this virtual world. And cover everything, from the basic layout, menus and tools panels, to useful plugins and real life applications. In addition to this, you will learn to use SketchUp with 3D printing, after the four weeks you will have received the skills necessary to take your designs one step further converting them from virtual 3d models into physical realities 

**Important:** Please bring your own laptop, with SketchUp already installed and a three-button mouse.

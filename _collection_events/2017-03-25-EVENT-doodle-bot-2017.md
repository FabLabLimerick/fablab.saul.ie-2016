Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite kids from ages 7 years and up to build their very own doodle bot. The doodle bot is a small robot that does random doodles/drawings. The kids will build it under the guidance of the Fab Lab team. They will be involved in Arts and crafts and some basic electronics.

Each child can bring home their own Doodle Bot. There are two sessions, starting at 10am and 2pm. Each workshop will last about 45 minutes. Parents or Guardians need to be present with the kids throughout the workshop.

The cost of the workshop is €15, and places are limited.

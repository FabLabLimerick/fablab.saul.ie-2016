The art of shadow puppetry provides endless possibilities for how to represent ideas using light and dark. Manufacturing components for complex shadow puppets can be challenging. Laser cutting provides an interesting new way to more easily fabricate complex components as well as a way to manufacture objects which would be difficult or even impossible to create otherwise.

Join U.S. artist Ivan Owen and local puppeteer Emma Fisher as they lead this workshop and share their combined knowledge, imagination and interest in the intersections between art, design and engineering.

This workshop has been designed to cater to people with a wide range of skill levels. Participants who are new to design will be welcome to select from pre-made templates which they can customize as a way to ease into design. Participants who have more experience will be helped through the design process to create their own idea from the ground-up. Stay tuned for example photos and videos of what can be made possible through this process!

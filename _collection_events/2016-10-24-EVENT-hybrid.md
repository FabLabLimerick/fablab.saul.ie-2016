From 24 October to 4 November 2016 in Limerick City
 Exhibition and Conference

Lace and textile are the product of multiple cultural, social and political influences. Limerick lace is the perfect example of this cross-pollination that with time has become part of the identity of Limerick city.

The Hybrid conference and exhibition will address the role of multiple influences in the creation of contemporary lace inspired work. Hybrid will address the role of lace and its social-economic history and how this once pure entity is continuously transforming and recombining in its use of materials, execution and consumption. The liminal space exists between tradition and new practice; it is an area where different rules apply and the creativity of multiple influences generates a new identity, and this is Hybrid.​
 
A multi-site exhibition and conference exploring the past, present and future of lace addressing the role of multiple influences in the creation of contemporary lace inspired work.

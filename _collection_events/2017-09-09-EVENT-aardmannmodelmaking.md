These modelling clay building workshops offer a truly unique experience and the opportunity to learn from an expert model maker how to make the world famous Aardman character Gromit.

The workshops provide a creative and hands-on activity for all ages! Participants will also get a rare chance to ask questions about Aardman Studios and hear about the animation process involved in the making of our award winning films.
And the fun doesn’t have to stop there. Participants can take their clay models home and try animating them using Aardman’s easy to use *Animate It!* software.

Three workshops available:
1. 11am - 12pm for Minimum 6 year Old Children
2. 12.30pm - 1.30pm for Minimum 6 year Old Children
3. 2pm - 3pm for Adults Only

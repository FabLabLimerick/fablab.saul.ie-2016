e-NABLE is a group of Makers, Engineers, Medical Professionals, Tinkerers, Teachers, Students, Artists, Philanthropists, Parents and "Ideas people" who have come together from across the globe to collaborate, innovate and re-design the 3d Printable open source design of a mechanical hand device that was released as the original "Robohand" open source file in 2012.

e-NABLE does not sell these devices - but instead - encourages parents and individuals to create them on their own, guides them in the building process and prints parts for those that need them.

The designers at e-NABLE offer their assistance and design skills at no cost to aid those that would like to DIY (do it yourself) one of these devices and has numerous members that are willing to take on individual cases to help custom design around different shaped hands or needs.

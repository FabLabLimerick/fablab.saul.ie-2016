FUTURE ARTIST MAKER LABS is a project which explores the potential for artists and creatives to experiment with digital fabrication in their artistic practice.

FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS exhibition and event programme explores how today’s artist-makers are embracing the latest digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC routers, to imagine, design and create artworks that otherwise might not be possible. FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS also highlights how artist-makers from across Europe are critically engaging with the Fab Lab ethos of open-source design, creative collaboration and hardware hacking, and how the combination of ‘new machines, new materials and new networks’ are beginning to make their mark.

The exhibition launches on Wednesday March 15th 2017 7pm with a talk from curator Declan Sheehan, everyone is welcome to take a first look at the latest exhibition in Fab Lab Limerick. FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS is open to the public from March 16th, each day Monday to Saturday, 9am to 5pm, until Saturday May 6th.

Curated by Declan Sheehan with assistance from Javi BuronGarcia, Fab Lab Limerick director, and Gustavo Valera, Ultra-Lab Madrid.

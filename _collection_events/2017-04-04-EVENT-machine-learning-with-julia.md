### Machine Learning with #Julialang

Julia was developed in MIT in 2012, to take advantage of the recent developments in compiler technology and computing. Julia is a high-level just-in-time compiler designed for high-performance computing. It runs as fast as statically-compiled languages such as C/Fortran but uses a very high-level dynamic language. It supports modern language features such as: map-reduce style parallelism and distributed computation, coroutines, automatic code generation, metaprogramming, dynamic type system, and multiple dispatch. It aims to solve the two-language problem by having a user-friendly, interactive, and dynamic language but statically compiling the code on the fly for optimal performance. In Julia, most of the math/stat/scientific/machine-learning libraries and packages are written in Julia itself which makes the entire workflow easy to explore, modify, and maintain.

In this talk, I will discuss my recent explorations of using Julia to implement machine learning algorithms exploiting various Julia features including most importantly parallelism, distributed computations, and meta-programming. The talk covers the following areas: parallel weight update across layers by Direct Feedback Alignment  (DFA) for deep learning architectures, population ensembling and evolution of machine learning models, as well as performance tracking and visualization.

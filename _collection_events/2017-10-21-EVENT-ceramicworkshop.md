This is a 3D printing workshop exploring the advantages of ceramic material - its versatility, beauty and structural benefits make this medium perfect for a wide range of purposes.

No prior experience with clay or 3D printing is required, although it would be beneficial due to the short duration of the course.

The workshop consists of introductions including the theory of 3D printing, methods and outcomes, hands-on practical guidance giving participants enough familiarity to revisit and use the machine in their own time. All participants will have the chance to use the printer. Workshop would be of particular benefit to makers, artists, model-makers/animators, sculptors.

Booking is essential, please book here: [link coming very soon!](https://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/ceramic-workshop-01/)
Participants are required to bring their own laptop, and a three buttoned mouse.

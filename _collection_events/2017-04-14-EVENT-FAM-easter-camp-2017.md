Kids will be encouraged to explore their own creativity and imagination with the use of tools like 3D printers and laser cutters under our skilled guidance. These tools present great possibilities, and through individual and group projects, kids will get a unique insights and hands-on experiences into the world of digital fabrication, through design process, problem solving and exploration of basic structural engineering and electronic principles.

All materials will be provided by Fab Lab Limerick and each child will be able to take home their individual projects. The camp will be over two days - Friday the 14th and Saturday the 15th, from 10:30am to 3:30pm.

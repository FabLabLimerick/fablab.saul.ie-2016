Aoife Browne, director of ESUVIA is the Artist who created “Digital Veil” in collaboration with Fab Lab Limerick, contributors, Ciaran Trotman, Yasmin McMahon and Georgina Johnson. 

The piece was produced as part of the Fab Lab's [FUTURE ARTIST MAKERS: Summer Bootcamp](http://fablab.saul.ie/events/futureartistbootcamp/), in July this year, which was co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.

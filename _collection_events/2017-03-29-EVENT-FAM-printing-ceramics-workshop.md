This workshop will explore the possibilities of 3D printing using a basic paste layer deposition extrusion process. While the workshop will start by using clay as a print material participants will be urged to explore the potential to use other materials. All participants must have a laptop. Admission is free, but space is very limited. Contact us fablab@saul.ie

Jonathan Keep is a UK-based artist noted for his freethinking approach to pottery and the ceramic form. Jonathan pushes the boundaries of his medium with a creative convergence of ceramics, multimedia, virtual reality and 3D printing. http://www.keep-art.co.uk.

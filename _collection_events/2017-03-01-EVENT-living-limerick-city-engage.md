*Share your views on the future direction of the city. How can we best take advantage of Limerick’s medieval heritage? What about Georgian Limerick? How can the city best connect to its greatest asset the River Shannon?*

Limerick City and County Council in conjunction with SAUL, the School of Architecture University of Limerick, will be posing questions through a new consultation process to collect people’s thoughts, hopes and opinions about living in Limerick. Living Limerick is about developing a vision for living in the historic core of Limerick City taking place throughout the week, for details on the other events, please check out [this page](http://saul.ie/news/events/living-limerick-engage-city/).

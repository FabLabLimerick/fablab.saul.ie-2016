e-NABLE Ireland is a new creative community of designers, engineers, tinkerers and makers working together to produce open source designs that make life better for others. This is our first official workshop where we will be sharing our first 3D printed prosthetic and launching our first two design challenges. Anyone is free to join in the research, brainstorming and idea generation process.

### Challenge 1: Prosthetic Design for the Developing World.
While 3D printing has dramatically reduced the cost of prosthetics, there are still millions of people in the Developing world in need of prosthetics, who do not have easy access to printers or healthcare. This challenge will look at possible solutions to these problems.

### Challenge 2:
The worldwide e-NABLE community have opened up a competition where the challenge is to create designs that help the visually impaired in education and everyday life. Examples include models that would help them visualize buildings and animals through feeling. There are great prizes to be won, and we will be helping people brainstorm and develop ideas.

This is a free event, but registration is needed. You can reserve your place [here](http://fablablimerick.ticketleap.com/open-source-prosthetic-workshop/

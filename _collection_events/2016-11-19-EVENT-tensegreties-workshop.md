In collaboration with the Limerick Festival of Science, and the Science and Engineering in UL, Fab Lab Limerick would like to invite kids from 10-15 years to build their own "tensegreties". Tensegreties are strong and light structures made out of struts and cables arranged such that the structure retains a 3D shape without the struts touching each other.

Kids will learn about the idea of tension and compression in structures, and see how these special structures work. They will see demonstrations on the laser cutter, and assemble their very own, laser cut "tensegreties" to take home."

Advance registration required, as places are limited. For booking please contact [Linda.Flannery@ul.ie](mailto:Linda.Flannery@ul.ie).
